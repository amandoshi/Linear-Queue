# Standard-Queue

This repository contains python and C code for a linear queue.

In C, the linear queue is implemented using a linked-list. The linked-list has an undefined length, and it can be queued and dequeued for an indefinite number of times.

In python, the linear queue is implemented using an array (implicit). The array has a defined length, and it can be queued and dequeued for a definite number of times.
